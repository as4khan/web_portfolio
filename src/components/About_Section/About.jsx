          <p> 
            My name is Areeb Khan, I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 
            With two internships under my belt, I am navigating the realms of hardware and software, fueled by a passion for their dynamic interplay. 
            As I stand at the crossroads, my eyes are set on the quantum computing industry, where I aspire to contribute to groundbreaking advancements. 
            Beyond the circuit boards and code, I find joy in anime and video games during my free time, providing a creative escape. 
            Excited about the limitless possibilities in technology, I am on a journey to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving landscape of quantum computing. 
            Let's connect and share insights on this incredible path!
